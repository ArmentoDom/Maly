Refined Prompt for Linking Event Host to Event Show Page

We're encountering an issue where the event show page is failing to load the event host’s information – for example, a request to /api/users/5 is returning a 404 ("User not found"). The intended functionality is:

The event object should have a valid host (creator) linked through its persistent user ID.

On the event show page, the host’s name and profile picture should appear at the bottom.

There should be buttons or options enabling the user to send a connection request or message the host.

Action Items:

Ensure Correct Host Linking on Event Creation:

Verify that when an event is created, the creator's user ID (creatorId) is correctly set and references a valid user record in the users table.

Remove any reliance on transient session IDs for host validation—use the persistent user ID only.

Fix the Event Show Endpoint:

Update the event show API endpoint so it reliably retrieves the event host’s details using the stored creatorId.

If a GET request (e.g., /api/users/5) returns a 404 for the event host, investigate why the user record isn’t found—ensure the correct user ID is being stored and queried.

Update the Event Show Page UI:

Modify the UI to display the event host’s profile:

Show the host’s profile picture.

Display the host’s name.

Provide actionable buttons like "Send Connection Request" and "Message."

Ensure that if host data isn’t found, a friendly fallback or error message is shown.

Testing and Validation:

After making these changes, test the full event show flow:

Create an event and confirm that the event host (creator) information is correctly linked.

Verify that the event show page displays the host’s details.

Ensure that connection request and messaging functionalities work as expected when interacting with the event host.

Please automatically implement these changes so that the event host is always properly linked and displayed on the event page, relying solely on a persistent user ID rather than session IDs.
