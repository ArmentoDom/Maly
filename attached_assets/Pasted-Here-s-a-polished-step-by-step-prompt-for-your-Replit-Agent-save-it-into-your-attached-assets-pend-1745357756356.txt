Here’s a polished, step‑by‑step prompt for your Replit Agent—save it into your `attached_assets/pending_tasks.md` so the agent can always refer back:

**Title:** Three UI fixes for network & profiles  

**Context:**  
Working in `Neumada_diagnosis` on the My Network, Connect, and Profile Show pages. We’ve made many enhancements but need these last three tweaks:

---

### 1) Add a “Back” button on My Network  
- **Where:** `client/src/pages/MyNetworkPage.tsx` (or wherever the My Network component lives)  
- **What to do:**  
  - At the top of the component, insert a `<Button>` or `<Link>` that navigates back (e.g. `onClick={() => history.back()}` or using Wouter’s `useLocation()[1]('/previous')`).  
  - Style it consistently with other “Back” buttons in the app (same icon, padding, and margin).  

### 2) Ensure all profile pictures fit correctly on Profile Show pages  
- **Issue profiles:** Samuel Garcia, Adrian, Svet, Maya Santos  
- **Where:** `client/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` (or similar)  
- **What to do:**  
  - Inspect the `<img>` or `<div>` wrapper that displays the user’s `profileImage`.  
  - Change CSS from something like `object-cover` or `background-size: cover` to `object-contain` (or adjust `background-position`) so faces aren’t clipped.  
  - Test each of the four problematic profiles to confirm full image visibility.  

### 3) Scroll to top on Profile Show navigation  
- **Where:** Same Profile Show component as above  
- **What to do:**  
  - In the route‑change handler (e.g. inside a `useEffect(() => { … }, [username])`), call `window.scrollTo(0, 0);` immediately after the component mounts.  
  - Verify that every time you navigate to `/profile/:username`, the view resets to the top.  

---

**Steps to implement & verify:**  
1. Clone/pull latest `main`.  
2. Edit the three files above, making the precise changes.  
3. Run `npm run dev` and manually test:  
   - My Network page shows a working Back button.  
   - Profile pages for **Samuel Garcia**, **Adrian**, **Svet**, and **Maya Santos** display full faces.  
   - Navigating to any profile always starts at the top of the page.  
4. Commit and push with message:  
   ```
   fix(ui): add back button, fix profile image fitting, scroll to top on profile
   ```  
5. Mark this task “Done” in `attached_assets/pending_tasks.md`.
