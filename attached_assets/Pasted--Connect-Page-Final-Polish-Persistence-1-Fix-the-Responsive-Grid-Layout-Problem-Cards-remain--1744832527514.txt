ðŸš€ Connect Page: Final Polish & Persistence
1. Fix the Responsive Grid Layout
Problem: Cards remain stuck to the left without spacing or centering.

Requested Action:

In ConnectPage.tsx (or its CSS module), locate the container wrapping the <UserCard /> components.

Replace any Flexbox hacks with a pure CSS Grid:

css
Copy
.connect-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(240px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;                /* uniform spacing */
  justify-items: center;    /* center each card */
  padding: 1rem;            /* avoid edge-clinging */
}
Remove any margin-left: 0 or justify-content: flex-start overrides.

Verify on desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpointsâ€”there should always be even margins around the cards.

2. Persist Edited Mood Across Pages
Problem: Mood updates succeed but disappear when navigating away and back.

Requested Action:

Confirm that the profileâ€‘update API (POST /api/profile) returns the updated currentMoods array in its JSON response.

In your clientâ€™s updateProfile mutation (e.g. in use-user.ts), after successful update, immediately write the new mood into:

React Query cache for ['user']

localStorage under maly_user_data

Ensure your useUser hookâ€™s useQuery is configured to use that updated cache instead of stale data (staleTime / refetchOnMount).

Add a navigation listener or useEffect in the Profile Edit page that, on mount, refetches the user if currentMoods from cache â‰  state.

Manually test:

Edit mood

Navigate to Discover

Return to Profile Edit â†’ mood must reflect your selection.

3. Overhaul Moodâ€‘Filter UI & Logic
Problem: Clicking mood filters has no effect and the UI is confusing.

Requested Action:

Replace the raw dropdown or icon list with pillâ€‘style toggles. Example component:

tsx
Copy
{MOODS.map(m => (
  <button
    key={m}
    className={selectedMoods.includes(m) ? 'pill--active' : 'pill'}
    onClick={() => toggleMood(m)}
  >
    {m}
  </button>
))}
Maintain selectedMoods: string[] in state and visually distinguish active pills.

On each change, re-fetch /api/users/browse?city=${city}&${selectedMoods.map(m=>moods[]=${m}).join('&')}

Ensure the query string exactly matches the serverâ€‘side parsing (req.query['moods[]']).

In /api/users/browse, verify the backend filters by:

ts
Copy
if (moodsArray.length) {
  query = query.where(users.currentMoods.overlaps(moodsArray));
}
Test combinations of 1â€“3 moods and confirm only matching users are returned.

âœ… Acceptance Criteria
Grid is centered, evenly spaced, and fluid across devices.

Mood edits immediately persist in UI and survive navigation.

Mood filters visually clear, selectable as pills, and actually narrow results.

Once each item is greenâ€‘lit, commit your changes and update attached_assets/connect-page-bugfixes.md with notes on what was done so the agent can refer back for verification. Good luck!
