**Refined Prompt for Implementing the Connect Feature**

Implement a Connect feature that enables users to send and manage connection requests. The user flow is as follows:

1. **Send Connection Request:**  
   - When User 1 clicks on User 2's profile in the Connect page, User 1 can send a connection request to User 2.
   - Record the request in the database with proper authentication.

2. **View Incoming Requests:**  
   - User 2 will have an "Incoming Connect Requests" tab where they can view all pending connection requests.
   - Each request should display relevant information about User 1.

3. **Accept or Decline Request:**  
   - Within the "Incoming Connect Requests" tab, User 2 can choose to either accept or decline each connection request.
   - If User 2 accepts the request, update the database so that both User 1 and User 2 become connected.

4. **Display Connections:**  
   - Once connected, both users should appear in each other's "Connections" tab.

**Implementation Requirements:**

- **Data Models:**  
  - Create or update necessary data models (e.g., connectionRequests, connections) to store request statuses and established connections.
  
- **API Endpoints:**  
  - Implement endpoints for sending connection requests, fetching incoming requests, and accepting/declining requests.
  
- **UI Integration:**  
  - Build the UI for the Connect page, "Incoming Connect Requests" tab, and "Connections" tab.
  - Include buttons for sending requests and for accepting or declining requests.
  
- **Real-Time Feedback:**  
  - Ensure that changes (like a request being accepted) update the UI automatically.
  
- **Automatic Execution:**  
  - Execute all changes directly in the codebase. Do not simply provide instructionsâ€”make the necessary code modifications, ensuring they integrate with our existing TypeScript project.
  
- **Testing and Debugging:**  
  - Provide clear inline comments and step-by-step instructions for running and testing the feature.
  - Verify that after implementation, the feature works as described, with users seeing incoming requests and correct updates to their connections list.

Implement these changes automatically and ensure that the Connect feature functions as described above.
