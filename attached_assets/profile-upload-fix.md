# Profile Image Upload Fix

## Issue Fixed

Previously, selecting a new profile image immediately triggered a profile update without waiting for the user to click the "Save" button. This caused:
- Premature profile updates with potentially incomplete data
- Profile records being updated multiple times unnecessarily
- Potential confusion for users who expected to review changes before saving

## Implementation Details

### The Fix

1. **Staged Image Uploads**: 
   - Images are now only staged in component state when selected
   - No network requests are made until the user explicitly clicks "Save"
   - Users can preview their selection before committing

2. **Consolidated Update Process**:
   - When the user clicks "Save", the workflow is:
     1. First upload the selected image to the server (if any)
     2. Then update the profile data with the new image URL and form data
     3. Redirect to the profile page only after all updates are complete

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Clear notification that image is selected but not yet saved
   - Consistent feedback about the save operation
   - No unexpected network requests on file selection

## Technical Implementation

- Added a new React state variable `selectedImageFile` to store the file
- Modified the image change handler to only update the preview locally
- Updated the form submit handler to upload the image as part of the save process
- Ensured proper cleanup of component state after successful save

## Benefits

- **Better Control**: Users have full control over when their profile updates are saved
- **Improved Data Integrity**: Profile updates happen in a single transaction
- **Enhanced UX**: Clearer feedback about what actions have been taken
- **Reduced Network Traffic**: Fewer API calls by batching changes
