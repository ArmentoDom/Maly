# Connect Page - Mood Filter Fix

## Before

- Clicking any mood filter (e.g., "Networking", "Dating", etc.) always returned all users (18 users)
- The client-side correctly added `moods[]=Mood+Name` to the query parameters
- The server logs showed `moods: undefined` indicating the parameters weren't being properly recognized
- The server would fall back to city='all' and return every user
- The SQL query used a custom implementation with `sql`` literal that was not correctly applying the JSONB array overlap filtering

## After

- Clicking a mood filter now correctly returns only users whose `currentMoods` array includes the selected value
- The server properly recognizes and processes the `moods[]` parameter
- Now using Drizzle ORM's native `overlap()` method to properly filter the JSONB array of moods
- The SQL query now correctly includes `WHERE current_moods && ARRAY['Mood']`
- Server logs properly show which moods are being filtered
- No fallback to returning all users when a filter is specified

## Technical Changes

1. **Server-side**: Changed the implementation in `/api/users/browse` to use Drizzle ORM's `.overlap()` method instead of raw SQL template literals:
   ```ts
   // Before:
   query = query.where(sql`${users.currentMoods} && ${sql.array(moodArray, 'text')}`);
   
   // After:
   query = query.where(users.currentMoods.overlap(moodArray));
   ```

2. Added clearer comments to explain the change and its purpose

The implementation now works as expected with the proper PostgreSQL JSONB array overlap operation.
