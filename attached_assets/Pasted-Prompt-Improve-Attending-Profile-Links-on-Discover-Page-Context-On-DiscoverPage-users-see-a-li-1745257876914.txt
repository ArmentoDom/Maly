Prompt: Improve “Attending” Profile Links on Discover Page

Context:
On DiscoverPage, users see a list of attendees’ avatars below each event. When I click “I’m attending,” my avatar appears—but:

My avatar remains a blank placeholder rather than my real profile image.

Clicking any attendee’s avatar (including mine) navigates to /profile/<id> and shows a “No profile found” page instead of that user’s profile.

Goal:

Ensure that when a user RSVPs, their real profile image is fetched and displayed among the attending icons.

Fix the attendee–avatar click handler so it routes to /profile/:username (not /profile/:id) and successfully renders that user’s profile page.

Tasks:

Verify RSVP State & Data:

Check the API response for the “attending” mutation to confirm it returns the attendee’s username and profileImage fields.

In the React state that holds the attending-user list, ensure you’re storing and rendering user.profileImage (fallback to avatar placeholder only if missing).

Render Correct Avatar:

In DiscoverPage (or its <EventShow> child), locate the JSX mapping over event.attendingUsers.

Change from something like:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<img src={user.profileImage || defaultAvatar} … />
to properly pull user.profileImage (e.g. user.profileImage instead of an undefined field).

Fix Click-to-Profile Route:

Change the avatar <Link> from linking to /profile/${user.id}
to /profile/${user.username}.

Ensure the profile route component (e.g. ProfilePage.tsx) reads the username from useParams() and queries the correct /api/users/:username endpoint.

Test & Validate:

RSVP as a test user, confirm your real image appears under “Attending.”

Click your avatar and another attendee’s avatar—verify you land on /profile/<username> and see their profile details instead of the “not found” screen.

Please update the Discover/Event‑Show component accordingly and commit those changes. Once fixed, attendees’ avatars should display correctly and route to the right username‑based profile page.
